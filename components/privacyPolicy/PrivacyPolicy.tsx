            be required to provide us with this information to sign up, but we will need it to
            provide you with a particular service. For example, as a buyer, we need your location to
            keep locked the flow of the market in your said location. As a Kwekmarket seller, if you
            choose to use our payment services, we may require information on your payment card,
            bank account information, or any proof of identification of payment required to provide
            our services to you and to comply with applicable law and sanctions. We will not store
            payment card information. Kwekmarket may contact individual shop owners confidentially
            to request more information about their listed items or to ensure compliance with our
